## Problem

`Before I started learning code and before I joined the GSG code academy I used to work as construction worker. So I was usually dealing with clients who wants to build thier homes, while also dealing with engineers so I knew about their problems and what they are struggling with, and i can say that the most common problems the client faces is that they doesn't know where to start from and they confused where to get construction tools and materials, and can't find an engineer who's fit for the job, on the other hand one of the engineers problems was that they can't find jobs. and from here the idea came to us so we decided to start working on it`

## solution
`
We created a web platform that gives the client the ability to hire an engineer and provide to you all the66 needed materials and tools that you need to complete your house.
